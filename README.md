# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Get the two coordinates from the user
### Step 2: Assign the variables for the coordinates
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG) 
### Step 4:End the program 
### PROGRAM:
```

x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=((x2-x1)**2+(y1-y2)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(distance))

```
## output:
![output](distance_ss.png)


### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two point is created successfully
